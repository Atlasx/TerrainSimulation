# Terrain Simulation
A terrain simulation for cs5610 Interactive Computer Graphics, work in progress.

## Texture Atlas Sampling

Based on a small input image, it will sample the texture atlas. This creates a virtual image larger than what could be done with just a single texture.

## Virtual Grid

This is the virtual grid that has a user-specified size. It can be any size and will create a virtual texture several times larger than the input texture.
